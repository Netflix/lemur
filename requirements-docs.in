# Note: python-ldap from requirements breaks due to readthedocs.io not having the correct header files
# The `make up-reqs` will update all requirement text files, and forcibly remove python-ldap
# from requirements-docs.txt
# However, dependabot doesn't use `make up-reqs`, so we have to replicate the necessary dependencies here
# Without including these dependencies, the docs are unable to include generated autodocs
