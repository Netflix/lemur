0.10.0 - `2021-06-28`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release introduces a breaking change (PR `#3646 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/pull/3646>`_) to the following API endpoint: 

- `POST /certificates/1/update/notify <https://lemur.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/index.html#lemur.certificates.views.Certificates.post>`_

The endpoint is now:

- `POST /certificates/1/update/switches <https://lemur.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/index.html#lemur.certificates.views.Certificates.post>`_

The new endpoint honors the existing `notify` request parameter, and additionally accepts a new `rotation` parameter. 
As a result of this change, the certificate table view now includes rotation switches and filtering by rotation status.


Other notable changes in this release:

- ACME:
    - New celery task to prevent duplicate certificates from being autorotated
    - ACME DNS-01 Challenges are supported in synchronous mode
    - DNS provider check fails gracefully if not found

    - SSO auth now returns a newly created user during initial login
    - CSRF protection is added to OAuth2.0
- Notifications:
    - New reissue failed notification
    - New reissue with no endpoints notification
    - New revocation notification
- Plugins:
    - Plugin option values are validated server-side
    - Some plugin option validations updated to compile successfully server-side
- Database:
  - Source and Destination deletions remove certificate associations with new confirmation dialog
- Dependency updates and conflict resolutions
- Expanded audit logs

And several smaller bugfixes and improvements.

Upgrading
---------

.. note:: This release will need a migration change. Please follow the `documentation <https://lemur.readthedocs.io/en/latest/administration.html#upgrading-lemur>`_ to upgrade Lemur.



0.7 - `2018-05-07`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release adds LetsEncrypt support with DNS providers Dyn, Route53, and Cloudflare, and expands on the pending certificate functionality.
The linux_dst plugin will also be deprecated and removed.

The pending_dns_authorizations and dns_providers tables were created. New columns
were added to the certificates and pending_certificates tables, (For the DNS provider ID), and authorities (For options).
Please run a database migration when upgrading.

The Let's Encrypt flow will run asynchronously. When a certificate is requested through the acme-issuer, a pending certificate
will be created. A cron needs to be defined to run `lemur pending_certs fetch_all_acme`. This command will iterate through all of the pending
certificates, request a DNS challenge token from Let's Encrypt, and set the appropriate _acme-challenge TXT entry. It will
then iterate through and resolve the challenges before requesting a certificate for each pending certificate. If a certificate
is successfully obtained, the pending_certificate will be moved to the certificates table with the appropriate properties.

0.6 - `2018-01-02`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Happy Holidays! This is a big release with lots of bug fixes and features. Below are the highlights and are not exhaustive.


Features:

* Per-certificate rotation policies, requires a database migration. The default rotation policy for all certificates is 30 days. Every certificate will gain a policy regardless of if auto-rotation is used.
* Adds per-user API Keys, allows users to issue multiple long-lived API tokens with the same permission as the user creating them.
* Adds the ability to revoke certificates from the Lemur UI/API, this is currently only supported for the digicert CIS and cfssl plugins.
* Allow destinations to support an export function. Useful for file system destinations e.g. S3 to specify the export plugin you wish to run before being sent to the destination.
* Adds support for uploading certificates to Cloudfront.
* Re-worked certificate metadata pane for improved readability.
* Adds support for LDAP user authentication

Bugs:

* Closed `#767 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/767>`_ - Fixed issue with login redirect loop.
* Closed `#792 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/792>`_ - Fixed an issue with a unique constraint was violated when replacing certificates.
* Closed `#752 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/752>`_ - Fixed an internal server error when validating notification units.
* Closed `#684 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/684>`_ - Fixed migration failure when null values encountered.
* Closes `#661 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/661>`_ - Fixed an issue where default values were missing during clone operations.

0.5 - `2016-04-08`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release is most notable for dropping support for python2.7. All Lemur versions >0.4 will now support python3.5 only.

Big thanks to neilschelly for quite a lot of improvements to the `lemur-cryptography` plugin.

Other Highlights:

* Closed `#501 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/501>`_ - Endpoint resource as now kept in sync via an expiration mechanism. Such that non-existant endpoints gracefully fall out of Lemur. Certificates are never removed from Lemur.
* Closed `#551 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/pull/551>`_ - Added the ability to create a 4096 bit key during certificate creation. Closed `#528 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/pull/528>`_ to ensure that issuer plugins supported the new 4096 bit keys.
* Closed `#566 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/566>`_ - Fixed an issue changing the notification status for  certificates without private keys.
* Closed `#594 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/594>`_ - Added `replaced` field indicating if a certificate has been superseded.
* Closed `#602 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/602>`_ - AWS plugin added support for ALBs for endpoint tracking.

0.4 - `2016-11-17`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There have been quite a few issues closed in this release. Some notables:

* Closed `#284 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/284>`_ - Created new models for `Endpoints` created associated AWS ELB endpoint tracking code. This was the major stated goal of this milestone and should serve as the basis for future enhancements of Lemur's certificate 'deployment' capabilities.
* Closed `#334 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/334>`_ - Lemur not has the ability to restrict certificate expiration dates to weekdays.

Several fixes/tweaks to Lemurs python3 support (thanks chadhendrie!)

This will most likely be the last release to support python2.7 moving Lemur to target python3 exclusively. Please comment
on issue #340 if this negatively affects your usage of Lemur.

Source Plugin Owners
--------------------

The dictionary returned from a source plugin has changed keys from `public_certificate` to `body` and `intermediate_certificate` to chain.


Issuer Plugin Owners
--------------------

This release may break your plugins, the keys in `issuer_options` have been changed from `camelCase` to `under_score`.
This change was made to break an undue reliance on downstream options maintains a more pythonic naming convention. Renaming
these keys should be fairly trivial, additionally pull requests have been submitted to affected plugins to help ease the transition.

.. note:: This change only affects issuer plugins and does not affect any other types of plugins.


* Closed `#63 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/63>`_ - Validates all endpoints with Marshmallow schemas, this allows for
    stricter input validation and better error messages when validation fails.
* Closed `#146 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/146>`_ - Moved authority type to first pane of authority creation wizard.
* Closed `#147 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/147>`_ - Added and refactored the relationship between authorities and their
    root certificates. Displays the certificates (and chains) next to the authority in question.
* Closed `#199 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/199>`_ - Ensures that the dates submitted to Lemur during authority and
    certificate creation are actually dates.

    should be easier to determine what authorities are available and when an authority has actually been selected.
* Closed `#254 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/254>`_ - Forces certificate names to be generally unique. If a certificate name
    (generated or otherwise) is found to be a duplicate we increment by appending a counter.
* Closed `#275 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/275>`_ - Switched to using Fernet generated passphrases for exported items.
    These are more sounds that pseudo random passphrases generated before and have the nice property of being in base64.

    via the UI.
* Closed `#289 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/289>`_ - Fixed and issue where intermediates were not being properly exported.
* Closed `#315 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/315>`_ - Made how roles are associated with certificates and authorities much more
    explicit, including adding the ability to add roles directly to certificates and authorities on creation.

* Closed #122 - Certificate API should allow for the specification of preceding certificates
    You can now target a certificate(s) for replacement. When specified the replaced certificate will be marked as
    'inactive'. This means that there will be no notifications for that certificate.
* Closed #139 - SubCA autogenerated descriptions for their certs are incorrect
* Closed #140 - Permalink does not change with filtering
* Closed #144 - Should be able to search certificates by domains covered, included wildcards
* Closed #165 - Cleaned up expiration notification template
