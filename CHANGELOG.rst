0.6 - `2018-01-02`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Happy Holidays! This is a big release with lots of bug fixes and features. Below are the highlights and are not exhaustive.


Features:

* Per-certificate rotation policies, requires a database migration. The default rotation policy for all certificates.
is 30 days. Every certificate will gain a policy regardless of if auto-rotation is used.
* Adds per-user API Keys, allows users to issue multiple long-lived API tokens with the same permission as the user creating them.
* Adds the ability to revoke certificates from the Lemur UI/API, this is currently only supported for the digicert CIS and cfssl plugins.
* Allow destinations to support an export function. Useful for file system destinations e.g. S3 to specify the export plugin you wish to run before being sent to the destination.
* Adds support for uploading certificates to Cloudfront.
* Re-worked certificate metadata pane for improved readability.
* Adds support for LDAP user authentication

Bugs:

* Closed `#767 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/767>`_ - Fixed issue with login redirect loop.
* Closed `#792 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/792>`_ - Fixed an issue with a unique constraint was violated when replacing certificates.
* Closed `#752 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/752>`_ - Fixed an internal server error when validating notification units.
* Closed `#684 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/684>`_ - Fixed migration failure when null values encountered.
* Closes `#661 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/661>`_ - Fixed an issue where default values were missing during clone operations.

Upgrading
---------

.. note:: This release will need a migration change. Please follow the `documentation <https://lemur.readthedocs.io/en/latest/administration.html#upgrading-lemur>`_ to upgrade Lemur.



0.5 - `2016-04-08`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release is most notable for dropping support for python2.7. All Lemur versions >0.4 will now support python3.5 only.

Big thanks to neilschelly for quite a lot of improvements to the `lemur-cryptography` plugin.

Other Highlights:

* Closed `#501 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/501>`_ - Endpoint resource as now kept in sync via an
expiration mechanism. Such that non-existant endpoints gracefully fall out of Lemur. Certificates are never
removed from Lemur.
* Closed `#551 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/pull/551>`_ - Added the ability to create a 4096 bit key during certificate
creation. Closed `#528 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/pull/528>`_ to ensure that issuer plugins supported the new 4096 bit keys.
* Closed `#566 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/566>`_ - Fixed an issue changing the notification status for  certificates
without private keys.
* Closed `#594 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/594>`_ - Added `replaced` field indicating if a certificate has been superseded.
* Closed `#602 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/602>`_ - AWS plugin added support for ALBs for endpoint tracking.

0.4 - `2016-11-17`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There have been quite a few issues closed in this release. Some notables:

* Closed `#284 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/284>`_ - Created new models for `Endpoints` created associated
AWS ELB endpoint tracking code. This was the major stated goal of this milestone and should serve as the basis for
future enhancements of Lemur's certificate 'deployment' capabilities.

* Closed `#334 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/334>`_ - Lemur not has the ability
to restrict certificate expiration dates to weekdays.

Several fixes/tweaks to Lemurs python3 support (thanks chadhendrie!)

This will most likely be the last release to support python2.7 moving Lemur to target python3 exclusively. Please comment
on issue #340 if this negatively affects your usage of Lemur.

This is quite a large upgrade, it is highly advised you backup your database before attempting to upgrade as this release
requires the migration of database structure as well as data.

Source Plugin Owners
--------------------

The dictionary returned from a source plugin has changed keys from `public_certificate` to `body` and `intermediate_certificate` to chain.


Issuer Plugin Owners
--------------------

This release may break your plugins, the keys in `issuer_options` have been changed from `camelCase` to `under_score`.
This change was made to break an undue reliance on downstream options maintains a more pythonic naming convention. Renaming
these keys should be fairly trivial, additionally pull requests have been submitted to affected plugins to help ease the transition.

.. note:: This change only affects issuer plugins and does not affect any other types of plugins.


* Closed `#63 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/63>`_ - Validates all endpoints with Marshmallow schemas, this allows for
    stricter input validation and better error messages when validation fails.
* Closed `#146 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/146>`_ - Moved authority type to first pane of authority creation wizard.
* Closed `#147 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/147>`_ - Added and refactored the relationship between authorities and their
    root certificates. Displays the certificates (and chains) next to the authority in question.
* Closed `#199 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/199>`_ - Ensures that the dates submitted to Lemur during authority and
    certificate creation are actually dates.
* Closed `#230 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/230>`_ - Migrated authority dropdown to an ui-select based dropdown, this
    should be easier to determine what authorities are available and when an authority has actually been selected.
* Closed `#254 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/254>`_ - Forces certificate names to be generally unique. If a certificate name
    (generated or otherwise) is found to be a duplicate we increment by appending a counter.
* Closed `#254 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/275>`_ - Switched to using Fernet generated passphrases for exported items.
    These are more sounds that pseudo random passphrases generated before and have the nice property of being in base64.
* Closed `#278 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/278>`_ - Added ability to specify a custom name to certificate creation, previously
    this was only available in the certificate import wizard.
* Closed `#281 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/281>`_ - Fixed an issue where notifications could not be removed from a certificate
    via the UI.
* Closed `#289 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/289>`_ - Fixed and issue where intermediates were not being properly exported.
* Closed `#315 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/315>`_ - Made how roles are associated with certificates and authorities much more
    explicit, including adding the ability to add roles directly to certificates and authorities on creation.



0.2.2 - 2016-02-05
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Closed `#234 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/234>`_ - Allows export plugins to define whether they need
    private key material (default is True)
* Closed `#231 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/231>`_ - Authorities were not respecting 'owning' roles and their
    users
* Closed `#228 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/228>`_ - Fixed documentation with correct filter values
* Closed `#226 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/226>`_ - Fixes issue were `import_certificate` was requiring
    replacement certificates to be specified
* Closed `#224 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/224>`_ - Fixed an issue where NPM might not be globally available (thanks AlexClineBB!)
* Closed `#221 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/234>`_ - Fixes several reported issues where older migration scripts were
    missing tables, this change removes pre 0.2 migration scripts
* Closed `#218 <https://github.com/Netflix/lemur/issues/234>`_ - Fixed an issue where export passphrases would not validate

* Closed #122 - Certificate API should allow for the specification of preceding certificates
    You can now target a certificate(s) for replacement. When specified the replaced certificate will be marked as
    'inactive'. This means that there will be no notifications for that certificate.
* Closed #139 - SubCA autogenerated descriptions for their certs are incorrect
* Closed #140 - Permalink does not change with filtering
* Closed #144 - Should be able to search certificates by domains covered, included wildcards
