Configuration
=============

.. warning::
    There are many secrets that Lemur uses that must be protected. All of these options are set via the Lemur configuration
    file. It is highly advised that you do not store your secrets in this file! Lemur provides functions
    that allow you to encrypt files at rest and decrypt them when it's time for deployment. See :ref:`Credential Management <CredentialManagement>`
    for more information.

.. note::
    All configuration values are python strings unless otherwise noted.


Basic Configuration
-------------------

.. data:: LOG_LEVEL
    :noindex:

    ::

        LOG_LEVEL = "DEBUG"

.. data:: LOG_FILE
    :noindex:

    ::

        LOG_FILE = "/logs/lemur/lemur-test.log"

.. data:: LOG_UPGRADE_FILE
    :noindex:

    ::

        LOG_UPGRADE_FILE = "/logs/lemur/db_upgrade.log"

.. data:: DEBUG
    :noindex:

    Sets the flask debug flag to true (if supported by the webserver)

    ::

        DEBUG = False

    .. warning::
        This should never be used in a production environment as it exposes Lemur to
        remote code execution through the debug console.


.. data:: CORS
    :noindex:

    Allows for cross domain requests, this is most commonly used for development but could
    be use in production if you decided to host the webUI on a different domain than the server.

    Use this cautiously, if you're not sure. Set it to `False`

    ::

        CORS = False


.. data:: SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI
    :noindex:

        If you have ever used sqlalchemy before this is the standard connection string used. Lemur uses a postgres database and the connection string would look something like:

    ::

        SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://<user>:<password>@<hostname>:5432/lemur'


.. data:: SQLALCHEMY_ENGINE_OPTIONS
    :noindex:

        This is an optional config that handles all engine_options to SQLAlchemy. 
        Please refer to the `flask-sqlalchemy website <https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/config/>`_ for 
        more details about the individual configs.

        The default connection pool size is 5 for sqlalchemy managed connections.
        Depending on the number of Lemur instances, please specify the per instance connection `pool_size`.
        Below is an example to set connection `pool_size` to 10.

        `max_overflow` allows to create connections in addition to specified number of connections in pool size.
        By default, sqlalchemy allows 10 connections to create in addition to the pool size.
        If `pool_size` and `max_overflow` are not specified then each Lemur instance may create maximum of 15 connections.

        `pool_recycle` defines number of seconds after which a connection is automatically recycled.

    ::

        SQLALCHEMY_ENGINE_OPTIONS = {
            'pool_size': 10,
            'pool_recycle': 600,
            'pool_timeout': 20,
            'max_overflow': 10,
        }


    .. warning::
        Specifying `pool_size` is an optional setting but important to review and set for optimal database connection usage and for overall database performance.
        Note that `SQLALCHEMY_POOL_SIZE`, `SQLALCHEMY_MAX_OVERFLOW`, `SQLALCHEMY_POOL_TIMEOUT` are deprecated since sqlalchemy v2.4.

    .. note::
        Specifying `max_overflow` to 0 will enforce limit to not create connections above specified pool size.



.. data:: LEMUR_ALLOW_WEEKEND_EXPIRATION
    :noindex:

        Specifies whether to allow certificates created by Lemur to expire on weekends. Default is True.

.. data:: LEMUR_ALLOWED_DOMAINS
    :noindex:

        List of regular expressions for domain restrictions; if the list is not empty, normal users can only issue
        certificates for domain names matching at least one pattern on this list. Administrators are exempt from this
        restriction.

        Cerificate common name is matched against these rules *if* it does not contain a space. SubjectAltName DNS names
        are always matched against these rules.

        Take care to write patterns in such way to not allow the `*` wildcard character inadvertently. To match a `.`
        character, it must be escaped (as `\.`).

.. data:: LEMUR_OWNER_EMAIL_IN_SUBJECT
    :noindex:

        By default, Lemur will add the certificate owner's email address to certificate subject (for CAs that allow it).
        Set this to `False` to disable this.

.. data:: LEMUR_TOKEN_SECRET
    :noindex:

        The TOKEN_SECRET is the secret used to create JWT tokens that are given out to users. This should be securely generated and kept private.

    ::

        LEMUR_TOKEN_SECRET = 'supersecret'

    An example of how you might generate a random string:

        >>> import secrets
		>>> import string
        >>> chars = string.ascii_uppercase + string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits + "~!@#$%^&*()_+"
        >>> secret_key = ''.join(secrets.choice(chars) for x in range(24))



.. data:: LEMUR_ENCRYPTION_KEYS
    :noindex:

        The LEMUR_ENCRYPTION_KEYS is used to encrypt data at rest within Lemur's database. Without a key Lemur will refuse
        to start. Multiple keys can be provided to facilitate key rotation. The first key in the list is used for
        encryption and all keys are tried for decryption until one works. Each key must be 32 URL safe base-64 encoded bytes.

        Only fields of type ``Vault`` will be encrypted. At present, only the following fields are encrypted:

        * ``certificates.private_key``
        * ``pending_certificates.private_key``
        * ``dns_providers.credentials``
        * ``roles.password``

        For implementation details, see ``Vault`` in ``utils.py``.

        Running lemur create_config will securely generate a key for your configuration file.
        If you would like to generate your own, we recommend the following method:

            >>> import os
            >>> import base64
            >>> base64.urlsafe_b64encode(os.urandom(32))

    ::

        LEMUR_ENCRYPTION_KEYS = ['1YeftooSbxCiX2zo8m1lXtpvQjy27smZcUUaGmffhMY=', 'LAfQt6yrkLqOK5lwpvQcT4jf2zdeTQJV1uYeh9coT5s=']


.. data:: PUBLIC_CA_MAX_VALIDITY_DAYS
    :noindex:

        Use this config to override the limit of 397 days of validity for certificates issued by CA/Browser compliant authorities.
        The authorities with cab_compliant option set to true will use this config. The example below overrides the default validity
        of 397 days and sets it to 365 days.

    ::

        PUBLIC_CA_MAX_VALIDITY_DAYS = 365


.. data:: DEFAULT_VALIDITY_DAYS
    :noindex:

        Use this config to override the default validity of 365 days for certificates offered through Lemur UI. Any CA which
        is not CA/Browser Forum compliant will be using this value as default validity to be displayed on UI. Please
        note that this config is used for cert issuance only through Lemur UI. The example below overrides the default validity
        of 365 days and sets it to 1095 days (3 years).

    ::

        DEFAULT_VALIDITY_DAYS = 1095


.. data:: DEBUG_DUMP
    :noindex:

        Dump all imported or generated CSR and certificate details to stdout using OpenSSL. (default: `False`)

.. data:: ALLOW_CERT_DELETION
    :noindex:

        When set to True, certificates can be marked as deleted via the API and deleted certificates will not be displayed
        in the UI. When set to False (the default), the certificate delete API will always return "405 method not allowed"
        and deleted certificates will always be visible in the UI. (default: `False`)

.. data:: LEMUR_AWS_REGION
    :noindex:

        This is an optional config applicable for settings where Lemur is deployed in AWS.
        When specified, this will override the default regional AWS endpoints that are used
        for accessing STS and services such as IAM for example. You must set this if running
        in an alternative AWS partition such as GovCloud, for example.

.. data:: LEMUR_AWS_PARTITION
   :noindex:

       Specifies the AWS partition that Lemur should use. Valid values are 'aws', 'aws-us-gov', and 'aws-cn'. Defaults to 'aws'.
       If Lemur is deployed in and managing endpoints AWS GovCloud, for example, you must set this to `aws-us-gov`.

.. data:: SENTRY_DSN
    :noindex:

        To initialize the Sentry integration to capture errors and exceptions, the `SENTRY_DSN` is required to be set to
        the respective URL. `LEMUR_ENV` is also a related variable to define the environment for sentry events, e.g.,
        'test' or 'prod'.

        Note that previously Lemur relied on Raven[flask] before migrating to `sentry_sdk`. In this case, you might be
        using the legacy `SENTRY_CONFIG`, which Lemur attempts to respect, in case `SENTRY_DSN` is missing,
        with environment set to empty.

        Example for using Senty to capture exceptions:

            >>>  from sentry_sdk import capture_exception
            >>>  ..
            >>>  capture_exception()
            >>>  # supplying extra information
            >>>  capture_exception(extra={"certificate_name": str(certificate.name)})


Certificate Default Options
---------------------------

Lemur allows you to fine tune your certificates to your organization. The following defaults are presented in the UI
and are used when Lemur creates the CSR for your certificates.


.. data:: LEMUR_DEFAULT_COUNTRY
    :noindex:

    ::

        LEMUR_DEFAULT_COUNTRY = "US"


.. data:: LEMUR_DEFAULT_STATE
    :noindex:

    ::

        LEMUR_DEFAULT_STATE = "California"


.. data:: LEMUR_DEFAULT_LOCATION
    :noindex:

    ::

        LEMUR_DEFAULT_LOCATION = "Los Gatos"


.. data:: LEMUR_DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION
    :noindex:

    ::

        LEMUR_DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION = "Netflix"


.. data:: LEMUR_DEFAULT_ORGANIZATIONAL_UNIT
    :noindex:

    ::

        LEMUR_DEFAULT_ORGANIZATIONAL_UNIT = ""


.. data:: LEMUR_DEFAULT_ISSUER_PLUGIN
    :noindex:

    ::

        LEMUR_DEFAULT_ISSUER_PLUGIN = "verisign-issuer"


.. data:: LEMUR_DEFAULT_AUTHORITY
    :noindex:

    ::

        LEMUR_DEFAULT_AUTHORITY = "verisign"


.. _NotificationOptions:

Notification Options
--------------------

Lemur supports a small variety of notification types through a set of notification plugins.
By default, Lemur configures a standard set of email notifications for all certificates.

**Plugin-capable notifications**

These notifications can be configured to use all available notification plugins.

Supported types:

* Certificate expiration (Celery: `notify_expirations`, cron: `notify expirations`)

**Email-only notifications**

These notifications can only be sent via email and cannot use other notification plugins.

Supported types:

* CA certificate expiration (Celery: `notify_authority_expirations`, cron: `notify authority_expirations`)
* Pending ACME certificate failure
* Certificate rotation
* Certificate reissued with no endpoints
* Certificate reissue failed
* Certificate revocation
* Security certificate expiration summary (Celery: `send_security_expiration_summary`, cron: `notify security_expiration_summary`)
* Certificate expiration where certificates are still detected as deployed at any associated domain (Celery: `notify_expiring_deployed_certificates`, cron: `notify expiring_deployed_certificates`)

**Default notifications**

When a certificate is created, the following email notifications are created for it if they do not exist.
If these notifications already exist, they will be associated with the new certificate.

* ``DEFAULT_<OWNER>_X_DAY``, where X is the set of values specified in ``LEMUR_DEFAULT_EXPIRATION_NOTIFICATION_INTERVALS`` and defaults to 30, 15, and 2 if not specified. The owner's username will replace ``<OWNER>``.
* ``DEFAULT_SECURITY_X_DAY``, where X is the set of values specified in ``LEMUR_SECURITY_TEAM_EMAIL_INTERVALS`` and defaults to ``LEMUR_DEFAULT_EXPIRATION_NOTIFICATION_INTERVALS`` if not specified (which also defaults to 30, 15, and 2 if not specified).

These notifications can be disabled if desired. They can also be unassociated with a specific certificate.

**Disabling notifications**

Notifications can be disabled either for an individual certificate (which disables all notifications for that certificate)
or for an individual notification object (which disables that notification for all associated certificates).
At present, disabling a notification object will only disable certificate expiration notifications, and not other types,
since other notification types don't use notification objects.

**Certificate expiration**

Certificate expiration notifications are sent when the scheduled task to send certificate expiration notifications runs
(see :ref:`PeriodicTasks`). Specific patterns of certificate names may be excluded using ``--exclude`` (when using
cron; you may specify this multiple times for multiple patterns) or via the config option ``EXCLUDE_CN_FROM_NOTIFICATION``
(when using celery; this is a list configuration option, meaning you specify multiple values, such as
``['exclude', 'also exclude']``). The specified exclude pattern will match if found anywhere in the certificate name.

When the periodic task runs, Lemur checks for certificates meeting the following conditions:

* Certificate has notifications enabled
* Certificate is not expired
* Certificate is not revoked
* Certificate name does not match the `exclude` parameter
* Certificate has at least one associated notification object
* That notification is active
* That notification's configured interval and unit match the certificate's remaining lifespan

All eligible certificates are then grouped by owner and applicable notification. For each notification and certificate group,
Lemur will send the expiration notification using whichever plugin was configured for that notification object.
In addition, Lemur will send an email to the certificate owner and security team (as specified by the
``LEMUR_SECURITY_TEAM_EMAIL`` configuration parameter). The security team will be omitted if
``LEMUR_DISABLE_SECURITY_TEAM_EXPIRATION_EMAILS`` is enabled.

**CA certificate expiration**

Certificate authority certificate expiration notifications are sent when the scheduled task to send authority certificate
expiration notifications runs (see :ref:`PeriodicTasks`). Notifications are sent via the intervals configured in the
configuration parameter ``LEMUR_AUTHORITY_CERT_EXPIRATION_EMAIL_INTERVALS``, with a default of 365 and 180 days.

When the periodic task runs, Lemur checks for certificates meeting the following conditions:

* Certificate has notifications enabled
* Certificate is not expired
* Certificate is not revoked
* Certificate is associated with a CA
* Certificate's remaining lifespan matches one of the configured intervals

All eligible certificates are then grouped by owner and expiration interval. For each interval and certificate group,
Lemur will send the CA certificate expiration notification via email to the certificate owner and security team
(as specified by the ``LEMUR_SECURITY_TEAM_EMAIL`` configuration parameter).

**Pending ACME certificate failure**

Whenever a pending ACME certificate fails to be issued, Lemur will send a notification via email to the certificate owner
and security team (as specified by the ``LEMUR_SECURITY_TEAM_EMAIL`` configuration parameter). This email is not sent if
the pending certificate had notifications disabled.

Lemur will attempt 3x times to resolve a pending certificate.
This can at times result into 3 duplicate certificates, if all certificate attempts get resolved. There is a way to
deduplicate these certificates periodically using a celery task ``disable_rotation_of_duplicate_certificates``.

This needs 2 configurations

.. data:: AUTHORITY_TO_DISABLE_ROTATE_OF_DUPLICATE_CERTIFICATES
    :noindex:

        List names of the authorities for which `disable_rotation_of_duplicate_certificates` should run. The task will
        consider certificates issued by authorities configured here.

    ::

        AUTHORITY_TO_DISABLE_ROTATE_OF_DUPLICATE_CERTIFICATES = ["LetsEncrypt"]


.. data:: DAYS_SINCE_ISSUANCE_DISABLE_ROTATE_OF_DUPLICATE_CERTIFICATES
    :noindex:

        Use this config (optional) to configure the number of days. The task `disable_rotation_of_duplicate_certificates`
        will then consider valid certificates issued only in last those many number of days for deduplication. If not configured,
        the task considers all the valid certificates. Ideally set this config to a value which is same as the number of
        days between the two runs of `disable_rotation_of_duplicate_certificates`

    ::

        DAYS_SINCE_ISSUANCE_DISABLE_ROTATE_OF_DUPLICATE_CERTIFICATES = 7


**Certificate re-issuance**

When a cert is reissued (i.e. a new certificate is minted to replace it), *and* the re-issuance either fails or
succeeds but the certificate has no associated endpoints (meaning the subsequent rotation step will not occur),
Lemur will send a notification via email to the certificate owner. This notification is disabled by default;
to enable it, you must set the option ``--notify`` (when using cron) or the configuration parameter
``ENABLE_REISSUE_NOTIFICATION`` (when using celery).

**Certificate rotation**

Whenever a cert is rotated, Lemur will send a notification via email to the certificate owner. This notification is
disabled by default; to enable it, you must set the option ``--notify`` (when using cron) or the configuration parameter
``ENABLE_ROTATION_NOTIFICATION`` (when using celery).

**Certificate revocation**

Whenever a cert is revoked, Lemur will send a notification via email to the certificate owner. This notification will
only be sent if the certificate's "notify" option is enabled.

**Security certificate expiration summary**

If you enable the Celery or cron task to send this notification type, Lemur will send a summary of all
certificates with upcoming expiration date that occurs within the number of days specified by the
``LEMUR_EXPIRATION_SUMMARY_EMAIL_THRESHOLD_DAYS`` configuration parameter (with a fallback of 14 days).
Note that certificates will be included in this summary even if they do not have any associated notifications.

This notification type also supports the same ``--exclude`` and ``EXCLUDE_CN_FROM_NOTIFICATION`` options as expiration emails.

NOTE: At present, this summary email essentially duplicates the certificate expiration notifications, since all
certificate expiration notifications are also sent to the security team. This issue will be fixed in the future.

**Notification configuration**

The following configuration options are supported:

.. data:: EXCLUDE_CN_FROM_NOTIFICATION
    :noindex:

    Specifies CNs to exclude from notifications. This includes both single notifications as well as the notification summary. The specified exclude pattern will match if found anywhere in the certificate name.

    .. note::
        This is only used for celery. The equivalent for cron is '-e' or '--exclude'.

       ::

          EXCLUDE_CN_FROM_NOTIFICATION = ['exclude', 'also exclude']


.. data:: DISABLE_NOTIFICATION_PLUGINS
    :noindex:

    Specifies a set of notification plugins to disable. Notifications will not be sent using these plugins. Currently only applies to expiration notifications, since they are the only type that utilize plugins.
    This option may be particularly useful in a test environment, where you might wish to enable the notification job without actually sending notifications of a certain type (or all types).

    .. note::
        This is only used for celery. The equivalent for cron is '-d' or '--disabled-notification-plugins'.

       ::

          DISABLE_NOTIFICATION_PLUGINS = ['email-notification']


**Email notifications**

Templates for emails are located under `lemur/plugins/lemur_email/templates` and can be modified for your needs.

The following configuration options are supported:

.. data:: LEMUR_EMAIL_SENDER
    :noindex:

    Specifies which service will be delivering notification emails. Valid values are `SMTP` or `SES`

    .. note::
        If using SMTP as your provider you will need to define additional configuration options as specified by Flask-Mail.
        See: `Flask-Mail <https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Mail>`_

        If you are using SES the email specified by the `LEMUR_EMAIL` configuration will need to be verified by AWS before
        you can send any mail. See: `Verifying Email Address in Amazon SES <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-email-addresses.html>`_


.. data:: LEMUR_SES_SOURCE_ARN
    :noindex:

    Specifies an ARN to use as the SourceArn when sending emails via SES.

    .. note::
        This parameter is only required if you're using a sending authorization with SES.
        See: `Using sending authorization with Amazon SES <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization.html>`_


.. data:: LEMUR_SES_REGION
    :noindex:

    Specifies a region for sending emails via SES.

    .. note::
        This parameter defaults to us-east-1 and is only required if you wish to use a different region.


.. data:: LEMUR_EMAIL
    :noindex:

        Lemur sender's email

        ::

            LEMUR_EMAIL = 'lemur@example.com'


.. data:: LEMUR_SECURITY_TEAM_EMAIL
    :noindex:

        This is an email or list of emails that should be notified when a certificate is expiring. It is also the contact email address for any discovered certificate.

        ::

            LEMUR_SECURITY_TEAM_EMAIL = ['security@example.com']


.. data:: LEMUR_DISABLE_SECURITY_TEAM_EXPIRATION_EMAILS
    :noindex:

        This specifies whether or not LEMUR_SECURITY_TEAM_EMAIL will be included on all expiration emails. IMPORTANT: You will also need to disable the DEFAULT_SECURITY_X_DAY notifications to truly disable sending expiration emails to the security team. This double configuration is required for backwards compatibility.

        ::

            LEMUR_DISABLE_SECURITY_TEAM_EXPIRATION_EMAILS = True

.. data:: LEMUR_DEFAULT_EXPIRATION_NOTIFICATION_INTERVALS
    :noindex:

        Lemur notification intervals. If unspecified, the value [30, 15, 2] is used.

        ::

            LEMUR_DEFAULT_EXPIRATION_NOTIFICATION_INTERVALS = [30, 15, 2]

.. data:: LEMUR_SECURITY_TEAM_EMAIL_INTERVALS
    :noindex:

       Alternate notification interval set for security team notifications. Use this if you would like the default security team notification interval for new certificates to differ from the global default as specified in LEMUR_DEFAULT_EXPIRATION_NOTIFICATION_INTERVALS. If unspecified, the value of LEMUR_DEFAULT_EXPIRATION_NOTIFICATION_INTERVALS is used. Security team default notifications for new certificates can effectively be disabled by setting this value to an empty array.

       ::

          LEMUR_SECURITY_TEAM_EMAIL_INTERVALS = [15, 2]

.. data:: LEMUR_AUTHORITY_CERT_EXPIRATION_EMAIL_INTERVALS
    :noindex:

       Notification interval set for CA certificate expiration notifications. If unspecified, the value [365, 180] is used (roughly one year and 6 months).

       ::

          LEMUR_AUTHORITY_CERT_EXPIRATION_EMAIL_INTERVALS = [365, 180]

.. data:: LEMUR_PORTS_FOR_DEPLOYED_CERTIFICATE_CHECK
    :noindex:

       Specifies the set of ports to use when checking if a certificate is still deployed at a given domain. This is utilized for the alert that is sent when an expiring certificate is detected to still be deployed.

       ::

          LEMUR_PORTS_FOR_DEPLOYED_CERTIFICATE_CHECK = [443]

.. data:: LEMUR_DEPLOYED_CERTIFICATE_CHECK_COMMIT_MODE
    :noindex:

       Specifies whether or not to commit changes when running the deployed certificate check. If False, the DB will not be updated; network calls will still be made and logs/metrics will be emitted.

       ::

          LEMUR_DEPLOYED_CERTIFICATE_CHECK_COMMIT_MODE = True

.. data:: LEMUR_DEPLOYED_CERTIFICATE_CHECK_EXCLUDED_DOMAINS
    :noindex:

       Specifies a set of domains to exclude from the deployed certificate checks. Anything specified here is treated as a substring; in other words, if you set this to ['excluded.com'], then 'abc.excluded.com' and 'unexcluded.com' will both be excluded; 'ex-cluded.com' will not be excluded.

       ::

          LEMUR_DEPLOYED_CERTIFICATE_CHECK_EXCLUDED_DOMAINS = ['excluded.com']

.. data:: LEMUR_DEPLOYED_CERTIFICATE_CHECK_EXCLUDED_OWNERS
    :noindex:

       Specifies a set of owners to exclude from the deployed certificate checks. Anything specified here is treated as an exact match, NOT as a substring.

       ::

          LEMUR_DEPLOYED_CERTIFICATE_CHECK_EXCLUDED_OWNERS = ['excludedowner@example.com']


.. data:: LEMUR_REISSUE_NOTIFICATION_EXCLUDED_DESTINATIONS
    :noindex:

       Specifies a set of destination labels to exclude from the reissued with endpoint notification checks. If a certificate is reissued without endpoints, but any of its destination labels are specified in this list, no "reissued without endpoints" notification will be sent.

       ::

          LEMUR_REISSUE_NOTIFICATION_EXCLUDED_DESTINATIONS = ['excluded-destination']


Celery Options
---------------
To make use of automated tasks within lemur (e.g. syncing source/destinations, or reissuing ACME certificates), you
need to configure celery. See :ref:`Periodic Tasks <PeriodicTasks>` for more in depth documentation.

.. data:: CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND
    :noindex:

        The url to your redis backend (needs to be in the format `redis://<host>:<port>/<database>`)

.. data:: CELERY_BROKER_URL
    :noindex:

        The url to your redis broker (needs to be in the format `redis://<host>:<port>/<database>`)

.. data:: CELERY_IMPORTS
    :noindex:

        The module that celery needs to import, in our case thats `lemur.common.celery`

.. data:: CELERY_TIMEZONE
    :noindex:

        The timezone for celery to work with


.. data:: CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE
    :noindex:

        This defines the schedule, with which the celery beat makes the worker run the specified tasks.

.. data:: CELERY_ENDPOINTS_EXPIRE_TIME_IN_HOURS
    :noindex:

        This is an optional parameter that defines the expiration time for endpoints when the endpoint expiration celery task is running. Default value is set to 2h.


Since the celery module, relies on the RedisHandler, the following options also need to be set.

.. data:: REDIS_HOST
    :noindex:

        Hostname of your redis instance

.. data:: REDIS_PORT
    :noindex:

        Port on which redis is running (default: 6379)

.. data:: REDIS_DB
    :noindex:

        Which redis database to be used, by default redis offers databases 0-15 (default: 0)

Authentication Options
----------------------
Lemur currently supports Basic Authentication, LDAP Authentication, Ping OAuth2, and Google out of the box. Additional flows can be added relatively easily.

LDAP Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lemur supports the use of an LDAP server in conjunction with Basic Authentication. Lemur local users can still be defined and take precedence over LDAP users. If a local user does not exist, LDAP will be queried for authentication. Only simple ldap binding with or without TLS is supported.

LDAP support requires the pyldap python library, which also depends on the following openldap packages.

.. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo apt-get update
      $ sudo apt-get install libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev libldap2-dev libssl-dev


To configure the use of an LDAP server, a number of settings need to be configured in `lemur.conf.py`.

Here is an example LDAP configuration stanza you can add to your config. Adjust to suit your environment of course.

.. code-block:: python

        LDAP_AUTH = True
        LDAP_BIND_URI='ldaps://secure.evilcorp.net'
        LDAP_BASE_DN='DC=users,DC=evilcorp,DC=net'
        LDAP_EMAIL_DOMAIN='evilcorp.net'
        LDAP_USE_TLS = True
        LDAP_CACERT_FILE = '/opt/lemur/trusted.pem'
        LDAP_REQUIRED_GROUP = 'certificate-management-access'
        LDAP_GROUPS_TO_ROLES = {'certificate-management-admin': 'admin', 'certificate-management-read-only': 'read-only'}
        LDAP_IS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY = True


The lemur ldap module uses the `user principal name` (upn) of the authenticating user to bind. This is done once for each user at login time. The UPN is effectively the email address in AD/LDAP of the user. If the user doesn't provide the email address, it constructs one based on the username supplied (which should normally match the samAccountName) and the value provided by the config LDAP_EMAIL_DOMAIN.
The config LDAP_BASE_DN tells lemur where to search within the AD/LDAP tree for the given UPN (user). If the bind with those credentials is successful - there is a valid user in AD with correct password.

Each of the LDAP options are described below.

.. data:: LDAP_AUTH
    :noindex:

        This enables the use of LDAP

        ::

            LDAP_AUTH = True

.. data:: LDAP_BIND_URI
    :noindex:

        Specifies the LDAP server connection string

        ::

            LDAP_BIND_URI = 'ldaps://hostname'

.. data:: LDAP_BASE_DN
    :noindex:

        Specifies the LDAP distinguished name location to search for users

        ::

            LDAP_BASE_DN = 'DC=Users,DC=Evilcorp,DC=com'

.. data:: LDAP_EMAIL_DOMAIN
    :noindex:

        The email domain used by users in your directory. This is used to build the userPrincipalName to search with.

        ::

            LDAP_EMAIL_DOMAIN = 'evilcorp.com'

The following LDAP options are not required, however TLS is always recommended.

.. data:: LDAP_USE_TLS
    :noindex:

        Enables the use of TLS when connecting to the LDAP server. Ensure the LDAP_BIND_URI is using ldaps scheme.

        ::

            LDAP_USE_TLS = True

.. data:: LDAP_CACERT_FILE
    :noindex:

        Specify a Certificate Authority file containing PEM encoded trusted issuer certificates. This can be used if your LDAP server is using certificates issued by a private CA.

        ::

            LDAP_CACERT_FILE = '/path/to/cacert/file'

.. data:: LDAP_REQUIRED_GROUP
    :noindex:

        Lemur has pretty open permissions. You can define an LDAP group to specify who can access Lemur. Only members of this group will be able to login.

        ::

            LDAP_REQUIRED_GROUP = 'Lemur LDAP Group Name'

.. data:: LDAP_GROUPS_TO_ROLES
    :noindex:

        You can also define a dictionary of ldap groups mapped to lemur roles. This allows you to use ldap groups to manage access to owner/creator roles in Lemur

        ::

            LDAP_GROUPS_TO_ROLES = {'lemur_admins': 'admin', 'Lemur Team DL Group': 'team@example.com'}


.. data:: LDAP_IS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY
    :noindex:

        When set to True, nested group memberships are supported, by searching for groups with the member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941 attribute set to the user DN.
        When set to False, the list of groups will be determined by the 'memberof' attribute of the LDAP user logging in.

        ::

            LDAP_IS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY = False


Authentication Providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are not using an authentication provider you do not need to configure any of these options.

        ::

            OAUTH2_VERIFY_CERT = True

.. data:: OAUTH_STATE_TOKEN_SECRET
    :noindex:

        The OAUTH_STATE_TOKEN_SECRET is used to sign state tokens to guard against CSRF attacks. Without a secret configured, Lemur will create
        a fallback secret on a per-server basis that would last for the length of the server's lifetime (e.g., between redeploys). The secret must be `bytes-like <https://cryptography.io/en/latest/glossary/#term-bytes-like>`;
        it will be used to instantiate the key parameter of `HMAC <https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/mac/hmac/#cryptography.hazmat.primitives.hmac.HMAC>`.

        For implementation details, see ``generate_state_token()`` and ``verify_state_token()`` in ``lemur/auth/views.py``.

        Running lemur create_config will securely generate a key for your configuration file.
        If you would like to generate your own, we recommend the following method:

            >>> import os
            >>> import base64
            >>> KEY_LENGTH = 32  # tweak as needed
            >>> base64.b64encode(os.urandom(KEY_LENGTH))

.. data:: OAUTH_STATE_TOKEN_STALE_TOLERANCE_SECONDS
    :noindex:

        Defaults to 15 seconds if configuration is not discovered.

        ::

.. data:: TOKEN_AUTH_HEADER_CASE_SENSITIVE
    :noindex:

        This is an optional parameter to change the case sensitivity of the access token request authorization header.
        This is required if the oauth provider has implemented the access token request authorization header in a case-sensitive way

        ::

            TOKEN_AUTH_HEADER_CASE_SENSITIVE = True

.. data:: USER_MEMBERSHIP_PROVIDER
    :noindex:

        An optional plugin to provide membership details. Provide plugin slug here. Plugin is used post user validation
        to update membership details in Lemur. Also, it is configured to provide APIs to validate user email, team email/DL.

        ::

            USER_MEMBERSHIP_PROVIDER = "<yourmembershippluginslug>"

Authorization Providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


If you are not using a custom authorization provider you do not need to configure any of these options

.. data:: USER_DOMAIN_AUTHORIZATION_PROVIDER
    :noindex:

        An optional plugin to perform domain level authorization during certificate issuance. Provide plugin slug here.
        Plugin is used to check if caller is authorized to issue a certificate for a given Common Name and Subject Alternative
        Name (SAN) of type DNSName. Plugin shall be an implementation of DomainAuthorizationPlugin.

        ::

            USER_DOMAIN_AUTHORIZATION_PROVIDER = "<yourauthorizationpluginslug>"

.. data:: LEMUR_PRIVATE_AUTHORITY_PLUGIN_NAMES
    :noindex:

        Lemur can be used to issue certificates with private CA. One can write own issuer plugin to do so. Domain level authorization
        is skipped for private CA i.e., the one implementing custom issuer plugin. Currently this config is not used elsewhere.

        ::

            LEMUR_PRIVATE_AUTHORITY_PLUGIN_NAMES = ["issuerpluginslug1", "issuerpluginslug2"]

Metric Providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are not using a metric provider you do not need to configure any of these options.

Entrust Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enables the creation of Entrust certificates. You need to set the API access up with Entrust support. Check the information in the Entrust Portal as well. 
Certificates are created as "SERVER_AND_CLIENT_AUTH".
Caution: Sometimes the entrust API does not respond in a timely manner. This error is handled and reported by the plugin. Should this happen you just have to hit the create button again after to create a valid certificate. 
The following parameters have to be set in the configuration files.

.. data:: ENTRUST_URL
    :noindex:
    
       This is the url for the Entrust API. Refer to the API documentation.

       Path to the certificate file in PEM format. This certificate is created in the onboarding process. Refer to the API documentation.
       
.. data:: ENTRUST_API_KEY
    :noindex:
    
       Path to the key file in RSA format. This certificate is created in the onboarding process. Refer to the API documentation. Caution: the request library cannot handle encrypted keys. The keyfile therefore has to contain the unencrypted key. Please put this in a secure location on the server.
       
.. data:: ENTRUST_API_USER
    :noindex:
    
       String with the API user. This user is created in the onboarding process. Refer to the API documentation.   
       
.. data:: ENTRUST_API_PASS
    :noindex:
    
       String with the password for the API user. This password is created in the onboarding process. Refer to the API documentation.

.. data:: ENTRUST_NAME
    :noindex:

        If there is a config variable ENTRUST_PRODUCT_<upper(authority.name)> take the value as cert product name else default to "STANDARD_SSL". Refer to the API documentation for valid products names.


.. data:: ENTRUST_CROSS_SIGNED_RSA_L1K
    :noindex:

        This is optional. Entrust provides support for cross-signed subCAS. One can set ENTRUST_CROSS_SIGNED_RSA_L1K to the respective cross-signed RSA-based subCA PEM and Lemur will replace the retrieved subCA with ENTRUST_CROSS_SIGNED_RSA_L1K.


.. data:: ENTRUST_CROSS_SIGNED_ECC_L1F
    :noindex:

        This is optional. Entrust provides support for cross-signed subCAS. One can set ENTRUST_CROSS_SIGNED_ECC_L1F to the respective cross-signed EC-based subCA PEM and Lemur will replace the retrieved subCA with ENTRUST_CROSS_SIGNED_ECC_L1F.


.. data:: ENTRUST_USE_DEFAULT_CLIENT_ID
    :noindex:

Hashicorp Vault Source/Destination Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lemur can import and export certificate data to and from a Hashicorp Vault secrets store. Lemur can connect to a different Vault service per source/destination.

.. note:: This plugin does not supersede or overlap the 3rd party Vault Issuer plugin.

.. note:: Vault does not have any configuration properties however it does read from a file on disk for a vault access token. The Lemur service account needs read access to this file.

Vault Source
""""""""""""

The Vault Source Plugin will read from one Vault object location per source defined. There is expected to be one or more certificates defined in each object in Vault.

Vault Destination
"""""""""""""""""

A Vault destination can be one object in Vault or a directory where all certificates will be stored as their own object by CN.

Vault Destination supports a regex filter to prevent certificates with SAN that do not match the regex filter from being deployed. This is an optional feature per destination defined.


AWS Source/Destination Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order for Lemur to manage its own account and other accounts we must ensure it has the correct AWS permissions.

.. note:: AWS usage is completely optional. Lemur can upload, find and manage TLS certificates in AWS. But is not required to do so.

Setting up IAM roles
""""""""""""""""""""

Lemur's AWS plugin uses boto heavily to talk to all the AWS resources it manages. By default it uses the on-instance credentials to make the necessary calls.

In order to limit the permissions, we will create two new IAM roles for Lemur. You can name them whatever you would like but for example sake we will be calling them LemurInstanceProfile and Lemur.

Lemur uses to STS to talk to different accounts. For managing one account this isn't necessary but we will still use it so that we can easily add new accounts.

LemurInstanceProfile is the IAM role you will launch your instance with. It actually has almost no rights. In fact it should really only be able to use STS to assume role to the Lemur role.

Here are example policies for the LemurInstanceProfile:

SES-SendEmail

.. code-block:: python

    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
            "ses:SendEmail"
          ],
          "Resource": "*"
        }
      ]
    }


STS-AssumeRole

.. code-block:: python

    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action":
            "sts:AssumeRole",
          "Resource": "*"
        }
      ]
    }



Next we will create the Lemur IAM role.

.. note::

    The default IAM role that Lemur assumes into is called `Lemur`, if you need to change this ensure you set `LEMUR_INSTANCE_PROFILE` to your role name in the configuration.


Here is an example policy for Lemur:

IAM-ServerCertificate

.. code-block:: python

    {
        "Statement": [
                    {
                         "Action": [
                              "iam:ListServerCertificates",
                              "iam:UpdateServerCertificate",
                              "iam:GetServerCertificate",

    }


Setting up STS access
"""""""""""""""""""""

Once we have setup our accounts we need to ensure that we create a trust relationship so that LemurInstanceProfile can assume the Lemur role.

In the AWS console select the Lemur IAM role and select the Trust Relationships tab and click Edit Trust Relationship

Below is an example policy:

.. code-block:: python

    {
      "Version": "2008-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Sid": "",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "AWS": [
              "arn:aws:iam::<awsaccountnumber>:role/LemurInstanceProfile",
            ]
          },
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
      ]
    }


Adding N+1 accounts
"""""""""""""""""""

To add another account we go to the new account and create a new Lemur IAM role with the same policy as above.

Then we would go to the account that Lemur is running is and edit the trust relationship policy.

An example policy:

.. code-block:: python

    {
      "Version": "2008-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Sid": "",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "AWS": [
              "arn:aws:iam::<awsaccountnumber>:role/LemurInstanceProfile",
              "arn:aws:iam::<awsaccountnumber1>:role/LemurInstanceProfile",
            ]
          },
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
      ]
    }

Setting up SES
""""""""""""""

Lemur has built in support for sending it's certificate notifications via Amazon's simple email service (SES). To force
Lemur to use SES ensure you are the running as the IAM role defined above and that you have followed the steps outlined
in Amazon's documentation `Setting up Amazon SES <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/setting-up-ses.html>`_

The configuration::

    LEMUR_EMAIL = 'lemur@example.com'

Will be the sender of all notifications, so ensure that it is verified with AWS.

SES if the default notification gateway and will be used unless SMTP settings are configured in the application configuration
settings.

NS1 ACME Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The NS1 ACME plugin allows DNS1 validation using NS1 domain services.

.. data:: NS1_KEY
   :noindex:

           The NS1 read/write API key for managing TXT records for domain validation

PowerDNS ACME Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following configuration properties are required to use the PowerDNS ACME Plugin for domain validation.


.. data:: ACME_POWERDNS_DOMAIN
    :noindex:

            This is the FQDN for the PowerDNS API (without path)


.. data:: ACME_POWERDNS_SERVERID
    :noindex:

            This is the ServerID attribute of the PowerDNS API Server (i.e. "localhost")


.. data:: ACME_POWERDNS_APIKEYNAME
    :noindex:

            This is the Key name to use for authentication (i.e. "X-API-Key")


.. data:: ACME_POWERDNS_APIKEY
    :noindex:

            This is the API Key to use for authentication (i.e. "Password")


.. data:: ACME_POWERDNS_RETRIES
    :noindex:

            This is the number of times DNS Verification should be attempted (i.e. 20)


.. data:: ACME_POWERDNS_VERIFY
    :noindex:

            This configures how TLS certificates on the PowerDNS API target are validated.  The PowerDNS Plugin depends on the PyPi requests library, which supports the following options for the verify parameter:

            True: Verifies the TLS certificate was issued by a known publicly-trusted CA. (Default)

            False: Disables certificate validation (Not Recommended)

            File/Dir path to CA Bundle: Verifies the TLS certificate was issued by a Certificate Authority in the provided CA bundle.

.. _CommandLineInterface:

Command Line Interface
======================

Lemur installs a command line script under the name ``lemur``. This will allow you to
perform most required operations that are unachievable within the web UI.

If you're using a non-standard configuration location, you'll need to prefix every command with
--config (excluding create_config, which is a special case). For example::

    lemur --config=/etc/lemur.conf.py help

For a list of commands, you can also use ``lemur help``, or ``lemur [command] --help``
for help on a specific command.

.. note:: The script is powered by a library called `Flask-Script <https://github.com/smurfix/flask-script>`_

Builtin Commands
----------------

All commands default to `~/.lemur/lemur.conf.py` if a configuration is not specified.

.. data:: create_config

    Creates a default configuration file for Lemur.

    Path defaults to ``~/.lemur/lemur.config.py``

    ::

        lemur create_config .

    .. note::
        This command is a special case and does not depend on the configuration file
        being set.


.. data:: init

    Initializes the configuration file for Lemur.

    ::

        lemur -c /etc/lemur.conf.py init


.. data:: start

    Starts a Lemur service. You can also pass any flag that Gunicorn uses to specify the webserver configuration.

    ::

        lemur start -w 6 -b 127.0.0.1:8080


.. data:: db upgrade

    Performs any needed database migrations.

    ::

        lemur db upgrade


.. data:: check_revoked

    Traverses every certificate that Lemur is aware of and attempts to understand its validity.
    It utilizes both OCSP and CRL. If Lemur is unable to come to a conclusion about a certificates
    validity its status is marked 'unknown'.


.. data:: sync

    Sync attempts to discover certificates in the environment that were not created by Lemur. If you wish to only sync
    a few sources you can pass a comma delimited list of sources to sync.

    ::

        lemur sync -s source1,source2


    Additionally you can also list the available sources that Lemur can sync.

    ::

        lemur sync


.. data:: notify

    Will traverse all current notifications and see if any of them need to be triggered.

    ::

        lemur notify


.. data:: acme

    Handles all ACME related tasks, like ACME plugin testing.

    ::

        lemur acme


Sub-commands
------------

Lemur includes several sub-commands for interacting with Lemur such as creating new users, creating new roles and even
issuing certificates.

The best way to discover these commands is by using the built in help pages

    ::

        lemur --help


and to get help on sub-commands

    ::

        lemur certificates --help



Upgrading Lemur
===============

To upgrade Lemur to the newest release you will need to ensure you have the latest code and have run any needed
database migrations.

To get the latest code from github run

    ::

        cd <lemur-source-directory>
        git pull -t <version>
        python setup.py develop


.. note::
    It's important to grab the latest release by specifying the release tag. This tags denote stable versions of Lemur.
    If you want to try the bleeding edge version of Lemur you can by using the master branch.


After you have the latest version of the Lemur code base you must run any needed database migrations. To run migrations

    ::

        cd <lemur-source-directory>/lemur
        lemur db upgrade


This will ensure that any needed tables or columns are created or destroyed.

.. note::
    Internally, this uses `Alembic <http://alembic.zzzcomputing.com/en/latest/>`_ to manage database migrations.

.. note::
    By default Alembic looks for the `migrations` folder in the current working directory.The migrations folder is
    located under `<LEMUR_HOME>/lemur/migrations` if you are running the lemur command from any location besides
    `<LEMUR_HOME>/lemur` you will need to pass the `-d` flag to specify the absolute file path to the `migrations` folder.

Plugins
=======

There are several interfaces currently available to extend Lemur. These are a work in
progress and the API is not frozen.

.. _iam_target:

Identity and Access Management
==============================

Lemur uses a Role Based Access Control (RBAC) mechanism to control which users have access to which resources. When a
user is first created in Lemur they can be assigned one or more roles. These roles are typically dynamically created
depending on an external identity provider (Google, LDAP, etc.), or are hardcoded within Lemur and associated with special
meaning.

Within Lemur there are three main permissions: AdminPermission, CreatorPermission, OwnerPermission. Sub-permissions such
as ViewPrivateKeyPermission are compositions of these three main Permissions.

Lets take a look at how these permissions are used:

Each `Authority` has a set of roles associated with it. If a user is also associated with the same roles
that the `Authority` is associated with, Lemur allows that user to user/view/update that `Authority`.

This RBAC is also used when determining which users can access which certificate private key. Lemur's current permission
structure is setup such that if the user is a `Creator` or `Owner` of a given certificate they are allow to view that
private key. Owners can also be a role name, such that any user with the same role as owner will be allowed to view the
private key information.

These permissions are applied to the user upon login and refreshed on every request.

    `Flask-Principal <https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Principal>`_

To allow integration with external access/membership management tools that may exist in your organization, lemur offers
below plugins in addition to it's own RBAC implementation.

Membership Plugin
-----------------

:Authors:
    Sayali Charhate <scharhate@netflix.com>
:Type:
    User Membership
:Description:
    Adds support to learn and validate user membership details from an external service. User memberships are used to
    create user roles dynamically as described in :ref:`iam_target`. Configure this plugin slug as `USER_MEMBERSHIP_PROVIDER`

Authorization Plugins
---------------------

:Authors:
    Sayali Charhate <scharhate@netflix.com>
:Type:
    External Authorization
:Description:
    Adds support to implement custom authorization logic that is best suited for your enterprise. Lemur offers `AuthorizationPlugin`
    and its extended version `DomainAuthorizationPlugin`. One can implement `DomainAuthorizationPlugin` and configure its
    slug as `USER_DOMAIN_AUTHORIZATION_PROVIDER` to check if caller is authorized to issue a certificate for a given Common
    Name and Subject Alternative Name (SAN) of type DNSName
