"""

This database upgrade updates the key_type information for either
still valid or expired certificates in the last 30 days. For RSA
keys, the algorithm is determined based on the key length. For 
the rest of the keys, the certificate body is parsed to determine 
the exact key_type information.

Each individual DB change is explicitly committed, and the respective
log is added to a file configured in LOG_UPGRADE_FILE or, by default,
to a file named db_upgrade.log in the current working directory.
Any error encountered while parsing a certificate will
also be logged along with the certificate ID. If faced with any issue
while running this upgrade, there is no harm in re-running the upgrade.
Each run processes only rows for which key_type information is not yet
determined.

A successful complete run will end up updating the Alembic Version to
the new Revision ID c301c59688d2. Currently, Lemur supports only RSA
and ECC certificates. This could be a long-running job depending upon
the number of DB entries it may process.
